# ``git`` Workflow

This repo follows STScI's guidelines for group-work in `git`. 

Please create a new branch in your fork per issue, and open a new issue or new pull request (PR) for bugs, feedback, or new features you would like to see. Mark this PR as "work-in-progress" while you are still working on the code. Once the code is ready for review, remove the "work-in-progress" and we will review the code and request you to make chances, if necessary, or let you know that the code works fine and has been merged.

If there is an issue you would like to work on, please leave a comment and we will be happy to assist. New contributions and contributors are very welcome!

The main development work is done on the "master" branch, pull requests should be made and submitted to the "master" branch.
